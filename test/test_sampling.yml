    # This is the file containing the data power spectra,
    # covariance and other metadata (window functions, bandpasses,
    # beams etc.).
    cells_coadded: ./test/test_out/cls_coadd.fits
    # This contains a fiducial power spectrum for a model that
    # roughly resembles the data. This is needed for the
    # Hamimeche and Lewis (H&L) likelihood. If you're not using that,
    # you can put garbage here.
    cells_fiducial: ./test/test_out/cls_fid.fits
    # This contains the noise power spectrum. Only needed for
    # H&L.
    cells_noise: ./test/test_out/cls_noise.fits
    # Null power spectra. Not really needed if you only care about
    # the likelihood part of the pipeline. Otherwise it should
    # contain a set of power spectrum combinations that should
    # be compatible with zero.
    cells_null: ./test/test_out/cls_coadd.fits
    # Power spectra computed by coadding all the different data
    # splits (including auto-correlations). As above, ignore this
    # if you only care about the likelihood part of the pipeline.
